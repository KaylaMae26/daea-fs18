     <p>In Upper Egypt lies the captivating archaeological necropolis known as El-Kab, or Nekheb in the ancient Egyptian. This massive burial ground contains the mortuary temples and tombs of numerous important rulers, and citizens of the ancient city of Nekheb, as well as remains of important ancient Egyptian figures from regions all over Egypt. The city flourished from the early Neolithic/Predynastic periods up until the Ptolemaic period. The city of El-Kab was constructed not only as a thriving urban city for ancient Egyptian citizens, but with great religious importance as well. El-Kab inherited its original name, Nekheb, from the principal deity of the city, Nekhbet, the vulture goddess of ancient Egyptian theology and one of two guardian deities of Pharaoh (Huyge 2013). A once powerful city in ancient Egyptian society, it is now the resting place of thousands of Egyptian citizens, soldiers, and rulers, and encaptures the mysticity of ancient Egyptian life.</p>

     <h3>Geography of El-Kab</h3>

 </figure>

 <p>El-Kab is an expanse of burial sites, mortuary temples, and ancient monuments that covers approximately 16 square kilometers of land on the east side of the Nile River in Upper Egypt, about 50 miles north of Thebes (Huyge 2013). The site is located in a harsh, desert terrain at the mouth of a vast valley of sand. The greatest monumental portion of the site the enormous, brick wall that encloses the entire city area. The wall encloses an area of about 71 acres, and is an incredible 40 feet thick (Breasted 1897). It’s height is mostly intact, standing at about 20 feet tall. The wall was most likely constructed in the New Kingdom, presumably during king Nektanbo II of the fourth century B.C. (Huyge 2013). Outside the wall is a desert poo pourri of broken pottery and old stone artifacts. Curiously though, hardly any pottery was discovered inside the walls — only in the surrounding desert area. Aside from the site within the walls, there is also an area outside of 18th dynasty tombs, numerous cemeteries outside the wall, and other temples further into the desert region surrounding the city walls. Surrounding temples include the temple of Amenhotep III, the rock of graffiti, and the temple of Rameses. (Quibell, 1898). El-Kab was established on a portion of land where irrigation would have been difficult not only because of the water level, but because of somewhat thin layer of deposited mud that settled rather than the common, rich soil that surrounds the Nile floodplains (Clarke 1922). Near site K in Image 3 stands a collection of poorly built but thoughtfully arranged houses, constructed of large stone pieces and low-quality mud used to keep it stuck together. The homes seem to be of the Ptolemaic era, as much of the sites constructs are. The sandstone that the buildings and monuments were constructed out of appeared to have been collected entirely from the surrounding hills (Clarke 1922).</p>
