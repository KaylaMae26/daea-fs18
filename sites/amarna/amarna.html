     <p>Known today as its Arabic names, el-Amarna or Tell-el-Amarna, Amarna was the capital city during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti in the New Kingdom. Amarna was built sometime during the 4th or 5th year of Pharaoh Akhenaten’s reign (1353-1336 BCE) and remained the capital of Egypt for 15-20 years until Akhenaten’s death when it was later moved to Memphis and then to Thebes by his successor, Tutankhamun (Originally Tutankhaten).</p>


     <p>During its habitation, Amarna was known then by its Egyptian name, Akhetaten, meaning “Horizon of Aten (or Aton)”. Aten was originally a minor deity with its name translated to light and represented with a sun disk hieroglyph (Ancient Egypt Gods: The Aten.” Pyramids of Ancient Egypt: Bent Pyramid of Sneferu, Dashur). Amarna was built to worship Aten and Akhenaten chose to build his new capital in this location because he thought the site had never been used to worship any other god.</p>


     <p>Amarna is an exception to what archaeologists typically see of a site because Amarna was not substantially occupied before or after the time of the capital and it therefore does not have a lot of urban buildup as is typically seen with Ancient Egyptian sites. Therefore, Amarna offers a large array of urban landscape that has been continually excavated since the 19th century.</p>

     <h3>A Brief Look at Akhenaten’s Religion</h3>

<p>The Aten was not a god that Akhenaten created rather, he was a minor deity associated with light and held various positions throughout the kingdoms. In the Old Kingdom, Aten was worshipped as an obscure aspect of the sun. During the Middle Kingdom, coffin texts represent Aten with a sun disk. In the story of Sinuhe, Pharaoh Amenemhat I is described as soaring into the sky and uniting with his creator, Aten (Ancient Egypt Gods: The Aten.” Pyramids of Ancient Egypt: Bent Pyramid of Sneferu, Dashur). In the rest of the New Kingdom’s history (besides the reign of Akhenaten) the Aten was considered to be a part of the composite deity Ra-Amun-Horus where Ra represented the sun during the daytime, Amun represented the sun in the underworld at night, and Horus represented the sunrise (Ancient Egypt Gods: The Aten.” Pyramids of Ancient Egypt: Bent Pyramid of Sneferu, Dashur).</p>


 <p>When Akhenaten became pharaoh, his name was originally Amenhotep IV (he changed it with his new religion so that it meant “he who is of service to the god Aten”). As pharaoh, he was responsible to maintain ma’at (harmony and balance) which he did for the first few years of his reign. When he decided to convert to Atenism, Akhenaten abolished the traditional Ancient Egyptian religion, closed temples and imposed his monotheistic view on the population. During this time Aten was considered the only god and unlike the previous gods, Aten had no human weaknesses and he was above human concerns. He simply existed and therefore, everything else existed. Even the population of Amarna did not practice this religion entirely. Archaeologists excavating at Amarna have found Bes (a dwarf that was believed to protect households) amulets and many other deities painted on pots and walls (Woolley, C. Leonard. “Excavations at Tell El-Amarna.” The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 8, No. ½). It was likely that the people also did not particularly take to the new religion because they were not allowed to communicate with Aten, only Akhenaten and his family could (Ancient Egypt Gods: The Aten.” Pyramids of Ancient Egypt: Bent Pyramid of Sneferu, Dashur).</p>


  <p>Even though Akhenaten has been hailed as the first monotheist, he crippled the Egyptian economy because it heavily relied on temples and it distracted the religious revolution distracted the king from foreign affairs (Mark, Joshua J. “Amarna.” Ancient History Encyclopedia, Ancient History Encyclopedia)</p>
