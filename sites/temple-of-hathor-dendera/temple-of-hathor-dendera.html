		 <p style="text-indent: 40px" >The Temple of Hathor, Dendera dates back to the Ptolemaic and Roman periods. As its namesake suggests, this temple is dedicated to the goddess Hathor. It is located within the modern-day city Qena, just south of the Nile River. This site is a complex of structures, but within my own research, I will only be focusing on the Temple of Hathor, which is the largest structure within the complex. Past and recent excavations of this structure have led to intriguing discoveries and has allowed for a better understanding of this Temple. An important element of this temple is that the surrounding structures, along with the Temple of Hathor, has been modified for various reasons since it was first constructed.</p>

     <h3>The Goddess Hathor</h3>

     <p style="text-indent: 40px" >The goddess Hathor was an important deity to the Egyptians, one of the most important deities in fact. She was the Egyptian goddess of the sky, love, motherhood, joy, dance, as well as foreign lands. Hathor’s origin story, though, began with a blood lust that could not be quenched. The myth states that Hathor (known as Sekhmet at this time) was released by Ra upon the humans to answer for their sins, Ra was quite displeased with how ungrateful the humans were. Other gods began to beg Ra for compassion for the humans, as there would be no humans left on earth to be worshipped by if this blood lust continued. Ra then tricked Sekhmet into drinking a blood red beer to knock her into slumber; she woke up in a state of compassion and became the goddess we now recognize her as. Hathor is included in various other myths as well, her presence within the Ancient Egyptian state was quite large, as each of her roles within different tales are unique. She is the daughter of Ra according to some stories, since he “created” her, but other tales would consider her as his mother or wife. Commonly, though, the goddess Hathor is known as Horus’s consort. Yearly, these two deities were reunited through a special religious event which included the statue of Hathor that stood within the Temple of Hathor. During the period of the lowest water levels of the Nile River, Egyptians would transfer the statue of Hathor upstream to the Temple of Horus in Edfu-Behedet to reunite the goddess Hathor with the god Horus. Edfu and Dendera are considered sister-cities because of this religious event which is known as the “Feast of the Beautiful Reunion (Marouard, 2016).” All these stories mark the goddess Hathor as a truly remarkable deity that the Egyptian held to a high standard.</p>

     <p style="text-indent: 40px" >It is commonly known that Egyptian deities are depicted as animals. These animals usually share a common trait with the deity it represents. Hathor’s animal counterpart is a cow. She is usually depicted with a body of a modern human, but with the head of a cow. Her motherly compassion has helped shaped this depiction. Another myth, that references Hathor as the “Goddess of the Sky,” says her four legs represents four pillars that hold up the sky. Her identifying feature would be her headdress. This headdress consists of two horns facing outwards with a sun-disc in-between the horns. Her horns represent her animal spirit: Bovines. While the sun disc is said to represent her title as the sky goddess (Seawright, 2002). The sun disc is also called the “Eye of Ra,” which was given to Hathor by the sun god.  </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 40px"  >The location of the Temple of Hathor is within Dendera, Egypt which is located in Upper Egypt. This ancient city is now known as todays Qena, Egypt. Dendera was the capital of the sixth Nome of Upper Egypt, Iqer. Iqer was also known as the Crocodile Nome. Dendera is also locate right off of the Nile River by a few miles, making the trek for the “Feast of the Beautiful Reunion” quite convenient.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 40px"  >The temple of Hathor is one of the best-preserved temples in Egypt (Marouard, 2016). Within this site there are many structures, but the largest is the Temple of Hathor. This temple consists of many chambers, few being: cult chambers for Hathor as well as other gods and goddesses, crypts, a treasury, and multiple other chambers as you can see in Image 3.</p>
