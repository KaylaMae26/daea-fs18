         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

		 <p>  The Temple of Hathor, Dendera dates back to the Ptolemaic and Roman periods. As its namesake suggests, this temple is dedicated to the goddess Hathor. It is located within the modern-day city Qena, just south of the Nile River. This site is a complex of structures, but within my own research, I will only be focusing on the Temple of Hathor, which is the largest structure within the complex. Past and recent excavations of this structure have led to intriguing discoveries and has allowed for a better understanding of this Temple.</p>

     <p>  The goddess Hathor was an important deity to the Egyptians, one of the most important deities in fact. She was the Egyptian goddess of the sky, love, motherhood, joy, dance, as well as foreign lands. Hathor is included in many myths, her presence within the Ancient Egyptian state was quite large, as each of her roles within different tales are unique. She is the daughter of Ra according to some stories, other tales would consider her as his mother or wife. Commonly, though, the goddess Hathor is known as Horus’s consort. Yearly, these two deities were reunited through a special religious event. A statue of Hathor stood with the Temple of Hathor. During the period of the lowest water levels of the Nile River, Egyptians would transfer the statue of Hathor upstream to the Temple of Horus in Edfu-Behedet to reunite the goddess Hathor with the god Horus. Edfu and Dendera are considered sister-cities because of this religious event which is known as the “Feast of the Beautiful Reunion (Marouard, 2016).” All of these stories mark the goddess Hathor as a truly remarkable deity that the Egyptian held to a high standard.</p>

     <p>  It is commonly known that Egyptian deities are depicted as animals. These animals usually share a common trait with the deity it represents. Hathor is usually depicted as a cow. She has a body of a modern human, but her head is usually of a cow. One myth depicts Hathor as a divine cow that birthed the world. Another myth, that references Hathor as the “Goddess of the Sky,” says her four legs represents four pillars that hold up the sky. Her identifying feature would be her headdress. This headdress consists of two horns facing outwards with a sun-disc in-between the horns. Her horns represent her animal spirit: Bovines. While the sun disc is said to represent her title as the sky goddess (Seawright, 2002). </p>
