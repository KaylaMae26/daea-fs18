     <p>The Ancient Egyptian site of el-Adaima is located along the west side of the Nile River. This particular site was inhabited from approximately 3700-2600 BC (). Adaima was discovered by a man named Jacques de Morgan in 1908. He was a French archaeologist who happened to be working in the area at the time of his grand discovery. Excavations of the site began shortly thereafter.</p>

      <p>After de Morgan's excavations, the site was left abandoned until it was rediscovered by Ferdinand Debono in 1973 (). Debono then began his own excavations into 30 different tombs. All of these gravesites were badly plundered by the time of his excavations. Unfortunately, in present day, this section of the cemetery is now completely destroyed.</p>

     <p>The site was next excavated in 1989 by Beatrix Midant-Reyes and the excavation lasted until 2005 (Breand, 2009).

    <h3>Location, Geography, Setting</h3>
    <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

     <p>Adaima is located on the West bank of the Nile River. Its relative location is between the modern day city of Esna and Hierakonpolis.</p>

     <p>The latitude and longitude of el-Adaima is as follows (in decimal degrees): 25.235833, 32.593611</p>

     <h3>Description of Site</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <p>The site of el-Adaima is divided into three different sections: the Western Cemetery, Eastern Cemetery, and settlement.</p>

     <p>The Western Cemetery had very few intact graves. These burials were badly plundered, and it is estimated to have happened during the Predynastic Period.</p>

     <p>The Eastern Cemetery is divided into two sections which are simply referred to as north and south. In total, 580 burials were excavated from the Eastern Cemetery alone. This burial ground was filled with mostly children’s graves. The north was filled with adults and children but was still predominately children. The south consisted of only children’s graves.</p>

     <p>The settlement envelopes the rest of el-Adaima. “The site represents the settlement of a small community without marked social differentiation.” (Breand, 2009).</p>

     <h3>Excavations</h3>

     <p>Adaima was discovered by Jacques de Morgan in 1908. He was a French archaeologist who happened to be working in the area at the time of his grand discovery. Excavations of the site began shortly thereafter. There is not a lot of specific information about his findings, or even the excavation in general.</p>

     <p>After Morgan, the site was left abandoned until it was rediscovered by Ferdinand Debono in 1973 (Patch, 2011). Debono then began his own excavations into 30 different tombs. All of these gravesites were badly plundered by the time of his excavations, and nowadays, unfortunately, this section of the cemetery is completely destroyed.</p>

    <p>Once again, Adaima was left and it was not excavated again until 1989. A woman named Beatrix Midant-Reynes headed the project. This period of excavation produced the largest amount of information, knowledge, and hard data. It was by far the most thorough and well-documented of the three excavations.</p>

    <h3>Results of Excavations</h3>

<p>During the most recent excavation (1989-2005) archaeologists and anthropologists working on site discovered a few cases of infectious diseases. This was an important find because it gives us knowledge about possible causes of death during the time period. It also allows for interpretation and analysis of these diseases, how they came about and were contracted, how they may have spread, and how they would have affected the people of Adaima.</p>

     <h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Overall, the site of el-Adaima was an important archaeological find. Its uniqueness in being a site with a settlement and gravesite that was used simultaneously was important because it allowed for comparisons to be made. Archaeologists could compare information from the settlement to the cemetery and analyze components such as social status, wealth, and religious beliefs.</p>

<p>According to Egyptologist Beatrix Midant-Reynes, “The multi-component character of Adaima, with its functionally specific activity areas and its domestic units give it a special importance as a site to collect data on Egyptian prehistory, palaeo-environment and subsistence strategy.” (Midant-Reynes, 239).</p>

<p>It is a shame that so much of the site was damaged and plundered. However, archaeologists, anthropologists, and Egyptologists were still able to find enough artifacts and information to learn about the people who once lived in this Ancient Egyptian site.</p>
