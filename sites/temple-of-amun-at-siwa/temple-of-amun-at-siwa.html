         <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>The temple of Amun in the Siwa Oasis is a place that is steeped in the history of Egypt and used to be a place of large cultural significance to the ancient Egyptians. Evidence from flint pieces show that the Siwa oasis has been occupied since Paleolithic and Neolithic times. The temple of Amun at Siwa is also known as the temple of the oracle. This is because the temple housed a divine oracle that became very famous in the ancient world. Unconfirmed oral history states that the oracle that resided here was so revered that every pharaoh in Egypt’s 28th dynasty traveled all of the way to Siwa to be officially acknowledged as a son of the Egyptian sun god and supreme god: Amon-Ra.
              When Alexander the great completed his conquest of Egypt he traveled to the temple. It is said that he traveled here because he desired the same divine declaration of power to legitimize the conquest and put himself on the same level as pharaohs past in the eyes of the Egyptian people. When the Roman era swept over the region, oracles went out of style along with almost all of the gods that the Egyptian people worshipped. The temple became unimportant and the decline of the Siwan people was under way.</p>
         <h3>GEOGRAPHIC AND GEOLOGIC INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>The Siwa Oasis sits about 31 miles (or 50 kilometers) east of Egypt’s modern-day border with Libya in the western desert. It is about 350 miles (or 560 kilometers) west-southwest of Egypt’s capital, Cairo. The oasis itself is about 4 ½ miles wide by about 6 miles long and has almost 200 springs within its borders. The temple of Amun itself sits on a natural plateau on the eastern side of the currently established city close to one of the many lakes in the area. The entire area is in a depression and actually sits about 62 feet (or 19 meters) below sea level. There are three main subsurface rock formations that make up the ground underneath the oasis. The Marmarica formation consists mainly of marine limestone with a few marly intercalations throughout and sits under most of the northern area of the oasis. The Moghra formation consists of shale and white bandy carbonates and lies below parts of the southern area of the oasis. The Moqattam formation is made up of mostly limestone and can be found underneath the southeastern part of the oasis. Sand dunes cover the rest of the southern and western parts of the oasis. Thanks to the many springs in the area the Siwa Oasis is very fertile and supports many olive trees and date palms.</p>

         <h3>Site Description</h3>
            <p>The temple of Amun resides on a small natural plateau and consists of an open court that leads into two separate halls. In the second hall is the sanctuary within the temple where the oracle likely resided. There is a small side corridor on the right of the sanctuary that is very narrow. Archaeologist Ahmed Fakhry thought this may have been a place where temple priests would speak for the Oracle where no one could see them. The only part of the temple with inscribed walls is the sanctuary. To the left of the sanctuary is another large chamber. There is evidence of a chamber on the roof of the temple, but whatever stairs led up to it had fallen long ago. It was constructed by Greek architects and dedicated to the Egyptian god Amon-Ra. The temple is not the only structure on the small plateau however. It is surrounded by the remains of the king’s palace (really just a governor’s palace, although Siwa was semi-independent for most of its history) and barracks to house soldiers in. Not far away from the main temple was a much smaller temple. Around the base of the plateau is the modern day village. The temple is in danger of collapse because the rock plateau that it is sitting on is cracking and being continuously eroded. Many fissures are visible in the rock and parts of the plateau have already collapsed, taking pieces of the temple and surrounding buildings with it. Structural preservation work was done in the 1990’s on the site. The north, west, and southern walls were all reinforced with stainless steel anchors and anchor plates. The cracks in the plateau rock were filled with concrete to try to stop the damage. Thankfully, the site should be stable for decades to come.</p>

         <h3>Site Excavations</h3>
            <p>There have been some archaeological excavations of the village of Siwa but the temple of Amun itself has never been properly excavated. Many archaeologists, Egyptologists, and explorers to the region took note of the temple and heard the oral history and legends of the temple passed down through the generations but none have ever done an official and proper excavation of the temple and its immediate surroundings. All of the information we have about the temple is from the observations of archaeologists and explorers along with the history and importance of the site that has been documented in both written and oral form by the Greeks and the Egyptians. There is evidence of remains from stone walls and possible some stone chambers in the immediate vicinity of the temple but there is no way of knowing if they are part of the temple itself or just outlying structures without proper study and excavation. The temple has been picked clean by looters in the hundreds of years since the decline of oracles. Sometimes people would take up residence in the abandoned temple, as Silva White has noted in his book From Sphinx to Oracle: Through the Libyan Desert to the Oasis of Jupiter Ammon. Silva White also notes that the people living in the area incorporated ancient architecture into their own homes by building onto walls and the leftovers of other ancient buildings. “At places, however, one can discover vestiges of the former shape and proportions of the Temple and other buildings connected with the cult of Jupiter Ammon. (Amun) Stately halls have been turned into modern hovels, one on top of another: but portions of the old walls—some of which have hieroglyphs—may still be examined by entering these dwellings.” (White 222) These looters and temporary residents were the cause of many of the damages to the interior of the temple. Specifically the inscriptions on two of the walls of the sanctuary in the temple of Amun, many of which are damaged.</p>
