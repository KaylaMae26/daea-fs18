  	 <p>Deir el-Medina, also known by its ancient name Set matt or “The Place of Truth”, was a worker’s village, on the west bank of the Nile across from Luxor, whose residents were the artisans who constructed the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens. The community was made up of craftsmen, painters, scribes, sculptors, and other types of workers who were considered to be some of the best in their respective positions. It is one of the best and most thoroughly documented communities in the ancient world. The first datable remains from this site date back to the reign of Thutmose I in the 18th dynasty and lasted until the Ramesside Period in the 20th dynasty. The primary job of the villagers was to build the tombs in the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queen, but it was also a popular pastime for the villagers to work on their own tombs when they had time off, which were no less detailed or impressive than those they had built for the pharaohs. The villagers, although make up of working-class men and women, were among the most literate communities in ancient Egypt, which correlates with the amounts of papyri and ostraca found at the site, as well has having a higher than average income for their social class. Much of the archaeological evidence found at this site details the administrative and business side of the work put into the building of the tombs as well as insight into the lives of the villagers themselves.</p>

<p>The site was first discovered between 1811 and 1815 and was excavated by scholars around the world, until the French Institute was formally given concession in 1917. Bernard Bruyere from the French Archaeological Institute in Cairo is one of the most prominent excavators and contributors to our knowledge of the site. He and his teams made four different trips to Deir el-Medina with their first excavation beginning in 1922 with the last ending in 1951. During these excavations they found houses of the workmen, tombs, documentary and literary documents, and limestone flakes called ostraca. One notable find was the intact 18th Dynasty tomb of a villager named Sennefer in 1928. This was noteworthy because many similar types of tombs had been plundered long before the team had arrived in Egypt. The tomb contained the coffins of Sennefer and his wife as well as items such as flowers, statuettes, pieces of furniture like chairs and tables, jewels, vases, and food that had been left for them by their families. Another important find by this team came towards with their final excavation of the site in 1951. Bruyere received information from local Egyptians that there was a Late Period tomb in the area that had not been discovered yet and he was determined to find it. He was forced to self-fund the excavation and did not have the means to use any machinery for the digging. Rather than finding the tomb the team was expecting, they found a rubbish dump used by the villagers. Although this was initially disappointing, the dump site contained more than 5,000 ostraca, the translation of which has revealed that they were documentary and literary archives of the community, giving archaeologists and Egyptologists an insight into the village and its workings that they had never had before.</p>
