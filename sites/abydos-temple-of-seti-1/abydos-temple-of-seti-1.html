		 <p>The Temple of Seti Ⅰ is a mortuary temple located in northern Upper Egypt, Abydos. The temple was built during the New Kingdom period. Built circa 1300 BC by Seti I and his son, Ramses II, the main monument of the Temple of Seti I contains many detailed reliefs that some would describe as it being among the best of the New Kingdom. Although, The temple of Seti I at Abydos is a mortuary temple, Seti himself was buried in the Valley of the Kings. Made of sandstone and limestone, the Temple of Seti I houses many sanctuaries. This monument is thought to be one of the most impressive religious structures in Egypt.

   <h3>Regional and Geographical Settings</h3>
   <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
   <p>The Temple of Seti I is located in Abydos, the 8th province in ancient Egypt. The area is considered to be amongst the most famous archaeological sites in the wortld. In ancient times it was called Abdu, and the Greeks called it Abydosabydos. A burial in Abydos was the ultimate honor for any local. Abydos is home to many tombs belonging to the 1st and 2nd Dynasties. Also, many Kings built temples here, including King Pepi I, King Ahmose I, King Seti I and King Ramses II. Ancient Egyptians believed that the tomb of Osiris, the “God of the Dead, and the Underworld” was located in Abydos, and it is where his head was buried.</p>

    <h3>Site Description</h3>
   <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
   <p>The modern name Abydos was developed by the Greek from the ancient name Abdju. The name of the nome or administrative district was Ta-wer, meaning “The Great Land”. The holy site of Abydos has a special charm, unparalleled with any place of antiquity. The site of Abydos induces a feeling of mystery and holiness in the respective visitor. The temple of Seti I has a majesty, here you can meet the spirit of the great warrior King. Walking on the little sand hills north of Seti’s  I, and Ramases’ temples towards Shunet el-Zebib. You get a glimpse of a lost civilization of the first two dynasties, and you feel a kind of religious mystery which was a characteristic of most holy sites of ancient Egypt. The ground is full of broken pottery,pieces of cloths, bones, remains of sun-dried bricks.

   <p> Most Egyptian temples are built to the same ground plan, but the temple of Seti Ⅰ deviates form it completely; the forecourt and pylons which lead up to its main entrance are destroyed, but the interior of the temple is wonderfully preserved. Seven chapels, all side by side form the centre and core of the structure, and each of these must be regarded as a special sanctuary. The sanctuaries were roofed with rounded arches cut from stone blocks, just like the large stone sarcoghi with their covers hollowed out on the inner side, intended to represent the starry heaven that curves over the world and dead. At the farther end of each, a hollow niche may be seen where a statue of the divinity once stood, and in the doorpost the holes to which door hinges were fixed, are still visible. In each of these sanctuaries a great god was worshipped. In the centre one was Amun, the great god of Thebes; to his left were Haramachis, god of Heliopolis, Ptah of Memphis, and Ra, the sun god; to his right the Triad of Osiris, Isis and Horus. Seven doors, all walled up nut for one led into the temple through the two vast pillared halls, which must be passed through to reach the sanctuary. In the first hall, the ceiling was supported by 24 columns, and in the second, which was larger ad finer, by 36. In the former there were four, and in the latter 6 groups of six, and the ways left open between these group columns led straight up to the door of the sanctuary, as did those between the outer columns and the wall. The ancient visitor who approached the chapel of Amun through the centre opening saw to the right and to the left and wherever his eyes might turn, nothing but pictures and inscriptions of Amun, while anyone approaching  the sanctuary of Osiris between the rows of pillars to the right, saw nothing but those referred to the rule or the underworld. Similarly each of the ways leading up towards the seven vaulted chapels at the further end of the second great hall was richly decorated according to the same principle. Only the highest priests and the king could enter the scared halls. </p>
