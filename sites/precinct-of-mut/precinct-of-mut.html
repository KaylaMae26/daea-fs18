		 <p>The Precinct of Mut is a temple compound within the larger Karnak Temple complex. The precinct was used as a religious center for much of the New Kingdom, Third Intermediate Period, and Late Period. The precinct was dedicated to the goddess Mut, who was known as the Queen of the Goddesses and the consort of Amun-Ra. The precinct contains at least six temples. Surrounding three sides of the main Temple of Mut is a lake that was considered sacred, called Isheru. The site is well known for the hundreds of statue dedicated to the lionness-headed goddess, Sekhmet, found there. The Mut Precinct recently reopened to the public in 2014 (2).</p>

<h4>Who was Mut?</h4>

     <p>The goddess Mut, pronounced "Moot," was part of the Theban Triad, alongside her husband, Amun, and their son, Khonsu (5). Mut was usually depicted in human form wearing the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, something usually reserved for kings and pharaohs, making her often interpreted as being closely linked to the kingship and being a protector of it (1). Other ways Mut was closely linked to the kingship was by being connected to cities of power, such as Memphis and Thebes (1). Mut also belongs to a group of goddesses called the Eye of Re. This group of goddesses were primarily as having the heads of cats or lionesses (2). Mut's Eye of Re form was known as Sekhmet, whose name meant "The Powerful" and who was also deeply connected to protecting the kingship (5). However, if not appeased with the proper rituals, Sekhmet could also destroy that which she protected (2).</p>

<h4>Location and Geography</h4>

<p>The Mut Precinct is located about 100 yeards south of the Amun Precinct in the Karnak Temple Complex in modern day Luxor. The Mut Precinct is oriented so that it faces the Amun Precinct (2). The Mut Temple sits on a peninsula on the lake Isheru to its south. This lake was deeply connected to the goddess of Mut and her connection to Egypt and the kingship. The fact that Isheru seems to wrap around the temple has often been seen to reinforce the idea of containing and appeasing the goddesses that make their home there (1).</p>

     <p>The Mut Precinct covers around 90,000 square meters of land and contains at least six temples, as well as the sacred lake in the south end, Isheru (5). Connecting the Mut Precinct to the Amun complex is a long avenue of Sphinxes, likely used during religious parades and processionals (2). The earliest standing remains date back to the New Kingdom under the reigns of Hatshepsut and her co-regent and successor, Thutmosis III, however, it has been suggested that a temple to Mut may have existed on the site since the Middle Kingdom (2). Over the years, hundreds of statues of the goddess Sekhmet were found around the Mut Precinct, most of which were inscribed to Amenhotep III and are believed to have initially come from his mortuary temple on the west side of the Nile (4). It's been estimated taht there may have been over 700 of these statues at the precinct at one time - two for each day of the year and were meant to help guarantee that the goddess was kept appeased (2). The structures in the precinct underwent numerous building phases before falling into disues as a religious center sometime in the 3rd or 2nd century B.C.E. (4). An example of this work was done under the rule of Ramesses II, who place two colossal statues of himself and two alabaster stelae in front of Temple A's first pylon (4). Temple A didn't become part of the actual Mut Precinct until the rule of Taharqa of Dynasty 25, when it became a mammisi, or "birth house" where they celebrated the birth of Mut and Amun's divine child, Khonsu (2). Also, during Taharqa's rule, Montuemhat, 4th Prophet of Amun, Mayor of Thebes and Governor of Upper Egypt directed work within the Mut Temple. Some of his work included a small chapel to himself within the temple's second court, now known as the Montuemhat Crypt, that described a lot of the work he did, and a small chapel dedicated to his son at the end of the Mut Temple's first pylon (2). These sorts of structures were highly unusual as private individuals weren't usually commemorated in this way, so it speaks to the amount of power that Montuemhat would have had during his lifetime (2).</p>
